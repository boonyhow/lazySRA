# Introduction
Downloading SRA files using metadata file downloaded from SRA run selector. This is by no means a professional project, and it is a personal project I embarked to ease my own sufferings from RNA-seq alignments. Always happy to hear feedbacks and what can be done better

## Server set up
Not all servers are equal, some are harder to deal with than the rest. I am currently working on SLURM compatible servers, however there might be other form of server managements I am not aware of and would look into if I have the time. Beyond that, do note that as STAR aligner is memory intensive, not all the parallelized operations can be done smoothly
